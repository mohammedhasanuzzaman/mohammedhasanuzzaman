          <br>Over the past few years, technology has evolved rapidly and has been adopted in the field of mental health for diagnosis or monitoring of patients. It began by employing various tools such as chatbots, and then expanded to embodied conversational agents (avatars) that involve a computer-generated character simulating a face-to-face conversation with verbal and non-verbal behavior. Based on previous findings, the younger generation is going to therapy less and less and on studies that show that young adults with mental and/or physical disorders are likely to use digital therapeutics to solve their health problems, this thesis project aims to create a digital humanoid avatar-therapist that can be consulted without any risk of judgment or social barrier. The avatar can also help therapists to automatically monitor their patients and thus save time. This avatar should be able to respond as humanely as possible by manifesting the three main keys to therapeutic empathy:<br>
          <br>1) Understanding what the patient is feeling, 2) Communicating and demonstrating that understanding through empathic responses, facial expressions, and postures, 3) Acting on that shared understanding in a therapeutic manner to help the patient.<br>

          <br>Deep learning models in recent years have demonstrated remarkable achievements; despite the success due to the use of cloud servers for DL training and inference, it faced significant challenges such as high latency, increased communication cost, and privacy concerns. To mitigate the drawbacks, efforts have been made to find the intersection between deep learning and a fine mesh of computing devices (edge servers) near-to-end devices. His research provides insight into behavior expected from centralized, decentralized, and distributed architecture while combining edge servers' computation and storage power. Research directions look into various enabling technologies and model adaption techniques that can be utilized for deep learning training and deployment across resource-constrained edge servers while minimizing the energy requirement, lowering communication message size, and decreasing the memory footprint.<br>

          <br>Machine learning for health event prediction has become increasingly popular as a result of the widespread use of electronic health records (EHR) in healthcare institutions. Historical diagnoses are a frequent component of EHR data utilized for machine learning-based predictions. Current research mostly views a diagnosis as an isolated disease and does not consider the clinical relationships among diseases during a visit. Many machine learning techniques presumptively treat diseases as static entities throughout patient visits. However, in actual practice, several disorders that are frequently diagnosed simultaneously reveal underlying patterns that are helpful for prediction. Furthermore, a disease's progression is not always linear because some illnesses might manifest differently from one patient visit to the next and even reappear. The goal of this project is to provide a context-aware learning framework that can be used to efficiently exploit this mix of disease information and examine the dynamics of diseases. By utilizing the patient's physiological and activity data, the aim of this research is to develop intelligent and privacy-focused context-aware decision support system for health monitoring.<br>

          <br>Artificial intelligence (AI) has made significant advancements in intelligent healthcare recently, opening up previously unimaginable prospects. Large amounts of data created during patient hospitalization during the last two decades have been spread in cyber-physical systems such as Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and Electronic Health Records (EHRs). ICD coding facilitates the storage, retrieval, and analysis of health information for evidence-based decision-making; sharing and comparing health information across hospitals, regions, settings, and countries; and data comparisons in the same site across different timelines.The application of deep neural networks to ICD coding has gained increasing attention. Deep neural networks can be used to extract and classify semantic data simultaneously, doing away with the requirement for medical expertise during feature selection. It structures algorithms in layers to create an “artificial neural network” that can learn and make intelligent decisions on its own.<br>
