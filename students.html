                    <p class="text-start">Over the past few years, technology has evolved rapidly and has been adopted
                        in the field of mental health for diagnosis or monitoring of patients. It began by employing
                        various tools such as chatbots, and then expanded to embodied conversational agents (avatars)
                        that involve a computer-generated character simulating a face-to-face conversation with verbal
                        and non-verbal behavior. Based on previous findings, the younger generation is going to therapy
                        less and less and on studies that show that young adults with mental and/or physical disorders
                        are likely to use digital therapeutics to solve their health problems, this thesis project aims
                        to create a digital humanoid avatar-therapist that can be consulted without any risk of judgment
                        or social barrier. The avatar can also help therapists to automatically monitor their patients
                        and thus save time. This avatar should be able to respond as humanely as possible by manifesting
                        the three main keys to therapeutic empathy:</p>
                    <ol class="text-start">
                        <li>Understanding what the patient is feeling,</li>

                            expressions, and postures,</li>
                        <li>Acting on that shared understanding in a therapeutic manner to help the patient.</li>

                    <p class="text-start">Deep learning models in recent years have demonstrated remarkable
                        achievements; despite the success due to the use of cloud servers for DL training and inference,
                        it faced significant challenges such as high latency, increased communication cost, and privacy
                        concerns. To mitigate the drawbacks, efforts have been made to find the intersection between
                        deep learning and a fine mesh of computing devices (edge servers) near-to-end devices. His
                        research provides insight into behavior expected from centralized, decentralized, and
                        distributed architecture while combining edge servers' computation and storage power. Research
                        directions look into various enabling technologies and model adaption techniques that can be
                        utilized for deep learning training and deployment across resource-constrained edge servers
                        while minimizing the energy requirement, lowering communication message size, and decreasing the
                        memory footprint.</p>

                    <p class="text-start pb-4">Machine learning for health event prediction has become increasingly popular as a result of the widespread use of electronic health records (EHR) in healthcare institutions. Historical diagnoses are a frequent component of EHR data utilized for machine learning-based predictions. Current research mostly views a diagnosis as an isolated disease and does not consider the clinical relationships among diseases during a visit. Many machine learning techniques presumptively treat diseases as static entities throughout patient visits. However, in actual practice, several disorders that are frequently diagnosed simultaneously reveal underlying patterns that are helpful for prediction. Furthermore, a disease's progression is not always linear because some illnesses might manifest differently from one patient visit to the next and even reappear. The goal of this project is to provide a context-aware learning framework that can be used to efficiently exploit this mix of disease information and examine the dynamics of diseases. By utilizing the patient's physiological and activity data, the aim of this research is to develop intelligent and privacy-focused context-aware decision support system for health monitoring.</p>

                    <p class="text-start">Keren received her Bachelor of Science degree in Information Technology at De La Salle University - Dasmariñas, Philippines. She then obtained her Master of Science in Engineering in Environmental Science and New Energy Technology degree at the Tsinghua-Berkeley Shenzhen Institute (TBSI) of Tsinghua University, China, where her research aimed to measure the transferability of features and the adaptability of domains between different sign languages.</p>

                    <p class="text-start">I am currently supervising Keren’s research on Sign Language Recognition and Translation at the ADAPT Centre, MTU, Cork. Keren is passionate about bridging the technological gap between high-resource and low-resource languages.</p> 

                    <h5 class="py-1 text-start">PhD Project</h5>
                    <p class="text-start pb-4">Sign language plays a crucial role in facilitating communication for people with hearing impairments. However, the availability of resources for sign language recognition (SLR) and translation (SLT) is severely limited, especially considering the existence of over 100 distinct sign languages.  Consequently, most studies only focus on a few of these sign languages, and even then, they primarily tackle word-level sign language recognition.

                        Sign languages are complete and distinct languages in their own right, possessing intricate linguistic structures, rules, and unique features.The primary objective of this PhD project is to develop an end-to-end system for continuous Sign Language recognition and translation to spoken language. Another objective is to address the low-resource nature of most sign language datasets. </p>

                        healthcare recently, opening up previously unimaginable prospects. Large amounts of data created
                        during patient hospitalization during the last two decades have been spread in cyber-physical
                        systems such as Hospital Information Systems (HIS) and Electronic Health Records (EHRs). ICD
                        coding facilitates the storage, retrieval, and analysis of health information for evidence-based
                        decision-making; sharing and comparing health information across hospitals, regions, settings,
                        and countries; and data comparisons in the same site across different timelines.The application
                        of deep neural networks to ICD coding has gained increasing attention. Deep neural networks can
                        be used to extract and classify semantic data simultaneously, doing away with the requirement
                        for medical expertise during feature selection. It structures algorithms in layers to create an
                        “artificial neural network” that can learn and make intelligent decisions on its own.</p>

                    <p class="text-start">Humor generation is a difficult task in the areas of computational linguistics, cognitive science for a few decades, and theorists have believed that incongruity contributes to the sensation of humor, many researchers studied logic, mathematical foundation, and computational model of humor. In this field, joke generation is very difficult whereas the researcher has proposed mathematical models to generate a fixed-structure joke. With the help of big data, the probabilistic model of sentence comprehension has helped to explain the features of the complex phenomenon of linguistic humor. The model selects the words and fills them with several fixed slots within a sentence structure rather than generating a complete joke, to
                        We designed a knowledge-based humor generation, an approach to learning embedding of the Knowledge Bases. We are using Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR ) Graphs where it deals with semantics of the sentence and  we integrate the AMR graph with Concept Net (External Knowledge), we pass these graphs through the GNN generator and we iterate it for certain epochs until the discriminator matches  the True Humor.
