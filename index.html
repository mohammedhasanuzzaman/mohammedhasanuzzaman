<p>I am a Lecturer at the <a href="http://cs.cit.ie/">Department of 
	Computer Science</a>, <a href="https://www.cit.ie/">Cork Institute of Technology</a>, Ireland.
	I am also a member of <a href="https://www.adaptcentre.ie/">ADAPT Centre</a>, Ireland's global centre of 
	excellence for digital content and media innovation, 
	where I worked as a Post-Doctoral Researcher from 2017 to 2019 under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.computing.dcu.ie/~away/">Prof. Andy Way</a>. 

My research interests and activities over the past 8 years have been in Natural Language Processing (NLP),
especially Temporal Information Extraction, Machine Translation, Psycholinguistics, Social Media Analytics and
Machine Learning applications to NLP. I have published more than 30 papers in a range of highly respected conferences
including ACL, SIGIR, NAACL, COLING, EACL, CoNLL, Hypertext, ECAI, ESWC, IJCNLP, and K-CAP.
I have also published papers in highly reputed journals such as PLOSOne, IEEE Intelligent Systems and TALLIP. </p>

<p>Prior to this, I earned my doctorate degree from the University of Caen Normandie, Caen, France.
I was hosted at the GREYC Laboratory, a joint collaboration between the French National Centre for Scientific Research 
	(CNRS), Ecole Nationale Supérieure d'Ingénieurs de Caen – ENSICAEN
and University of Caen Normandie during my doctoral studies.
In my doctoral studies, I introduced a temporal ontology namely TempoWordNet where word senses are associated with their
intrinsic temporal dimensions: atemporal, past, present, and future.
The developed resource was released publicly in March 2014.
Till date, the resource is downloaded more than 10,000 times all over the world.
TempoWordNet can be accessed from the open multilingual WordNets website (http://compling.hss.ntu.edu.sg/omw/), managed by 
	Nanyang Technological University, Singapore. After finishing my PhD studies, I worked briefly 
	for a social media analytics company based in Hong Kong as Natural 
	Language Processing Researcher.  </p>

<p> I was awarded with PhD Scholarship from the French Ministry of Superior Education and Research, Govt. of France 
	for my doctoral studies.
	In the year 2018, I received Erasmus+ staff mobility award for teaching and training. 
	I have also received the Dublin City University INVENT Award
for Engagement with Business/Industry for the year 2018. Currently, I am supervising two PhD students from IIT Patna 
	jointly with some of the world leading Computer scientists. Till date, I have 
	supervised more than 15 Master thesis from Dublin City University, Ireland and IIT, Patna, India.
